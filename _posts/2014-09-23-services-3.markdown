The ULS has partnered with faculty and doctoral students from the School of Information Science to present a [recurring workshop series](https://www.library.pitt.edu/workshops-tours) exploring the topics and tools of digital scholarship.  A new round of workshops is scheduled every fall and spring term, but training is also available on-demand, or through scheduled consultations at any time.
