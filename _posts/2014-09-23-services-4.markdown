Ensuring the long-term survival and accessibility of your digital scholarship is not always a simple task: formats and platforms change, and data must be well-described and managed to be understood by others.  Expertise in digital stewardship is a natural extension of the library's role of curating and stewarding information; we provide guidance and support with a special focus on digital modes of scholarship.
